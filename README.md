# todo_list

A to-do list application helps you organize tasks, set priorities, and manage deadlines effectively. Capture, prioritize, and schedule tasks to stay on top of your responsibilities. Regularly review and adjust your list to ensure optimal productivity, and utilize reminders for important deadlines. Sync across devices for seamless access wherever you go.
